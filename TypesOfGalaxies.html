    <h3>TYPES OF GALAXIES:</h3>
    <h4>Ellipticals </h4>
    <p> The Hubble classification system rates elliptical galaxies on the basis of their ellipticity, ranging
         from E0, being nearly spherical, up to E7, which is highly elongated. These galaxies have an 
         ellipsoidal profile, giving them an elliptical appearance regardless of the viewing angle. 
         Their appearance shows little structure and they typically have relatively little interstellar matter.
         Consequently, these galaxies also have a low portion of open clusters and a reduced rate of new star
         formation. Instead, they are dominated by generally older, more evolved stars that are orbiting the 
         common center of gravity in random directions. The stars contain low abundances of heavy elements 
         because star formation ceases after the initial burst. In this sense they have some similarity to the 
         much smaller globular clusters.[74]</p>
    
    <h4> Type-cD galaxies</h4>
    <p> The largest galaxies are the type-cD galaxies. First described in 1964 by a paper by Thomas A. Matthews 
        and others,[75] they are a subtype of the more general class of D galaxies, which are giant elliptical 
        galaxies, except that they are much larger. They are popularly known as the supergiant elliptical 
        galaxies and constitute the largest and most luminous galaxies known. These galaxies feature a central 
        elliptical nucleus with an extensive, faint halo of stars extending to megaparsec scales.[76] The profile 
        of their surface brightnesses as a function of their radius (or distance from their cores) falls off 
        more slowly than their smaller counterparts.[77]</p>
    
    <h4> Shell galaxy</h4>
    <p> A shell galaxy is a type of elliptical galaxy where the stars in its halo are arranged in concentric 
        shells. About one-tenth of elliptical galaxies have a shell-like structure, which has never been 
        observed in spiral galaxies. These structures are thought to develop when a larger galaxy absorbs a 
        smaller companion galaxyâ€”that as the two galaxy centers approach, they start to oscillate around a 
        center point, and the oscillation creates gravitational ripples forming the shells of stars, similar 
        to ripples spreading on water. For example, galaxy NGC 3923 has over 20 shells.[82]</p>
