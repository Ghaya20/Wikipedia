            <p class="para"> A galaxy is a system of <b>stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust</b>, and <b>dark matter</b> bound together by gravity.[1]
            [2] The word is derived from the Greek galaxias (γαλαξίας), literally 'milky', a reference to the Milky Way galaxy that 
            contains the Solar System. Galaxies</p>

            <p>averaging an estimated 100 million stars,[3] range in size from dwarfs with less 
            than a thousand stars,[4] to the largest galaxies known as supergiants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting 
            its galaxy's center of mass. Most of the mass in a typical galaxy is in the form of dark matter, with only a few 
            percent of that mass visible in the form of stars and nebulae. Supermassive black holes are a common feature at the 
            centres of galaxies</p>

            <p> Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical,[5] spiral, or irregular.[6] The Milky Way 
            is an example of a spiral galaxy. It is estimated that there are between 200 billion[7] (2×1011) to 2 trillion[8] 
            galaxies in the observable universe. Most galaxies are 1,000 to 100,000 parsecs in diameter (approximately 3,000 to 
            300,000 light years) and are separated by distances on the order of millions of parsecs (or megaparsecs). For comparison,
             the Milky Way has a diameter of at least 26,800 parsecs (87,400 ly)[9][a] and is separated from the Andromeda Galaxy, 
             its nearest large neighbor, by just over 750,000 parsecs (2.5 million ly.)[12]</p>

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p> The word galaxy was borrowed via French and Medieval Latin from the Greek term for the Milky Way, galaxías (kúklos) 
                γαλαξίας (κύκλος)[15][16] 'milky (circle)', named after its appearance as a milky band of light in the sky. In Greek 
                mythology, Zeus places his son born by a mortal woman, the infant Heracles, on Hera's breast while she is asleep so 
                the baby will drink her divine milk and thus become immortal. Hera wakes up while breastfeeding and then realizes she 
                is nursing an unknown baby: she pushes the baby away, some of her milk spills, and it produces the band of light known 
                as the Milky Way.[17][18]In the astronomical literature, the capitalized word "Galaxy" is often used to refer to the 
                Milky Way galaxy, to distinguish it from the other galaxies in the observable universe. The English term Milky Way 
                can be traced back to a story by Geoffrey Chaucer c. 1380:
                <footer> </footer>
                See yonder, lo, the Galaxyë
                 Which men clepeth the Milky Wey,
                 For hit is whyt.

            <h2>Nomenclature</h2>
            <p> Millions of galaxies have been catalogued, but only a few have well-established names, such as the Andromeda Galaxy,
                 the Magellanic Clouds, the Whirlpool Galaxy, and the Sombrero Galaxy. Astronomers work with numbers from certain 
                 catalogues, such as the Messier catalogue, the NGC (New General Catalogue), the IC (Index Catalogue), the CGCG 
                 (Catalogue of Galaxies and of Clusters of Galaxies), the MCG (Morphological Catalogue of Galaxies), the UGC (Uppsala
                  General Catalogue of Galaxies), and the PGC (Catalogue of Principal Galaxies, also known as LEDA). All the well-
                  known galaxies appear in one or more of these catalogs but each time under a different number. For example, 
                  Messier 109 (or "M109") is a spiral galaxy having the number 109 in the catalog of Messier. It also has the 
                  designations NGC 3992, UGC 6937, CGCG 269–023, MCG +09-20-044, and PGC 37617 (or LEDA 37617), among others.[20] 
                  Millions of fainter galaxies are known by their identifiers in sky surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.[21]</p>

            <h2> Multi-wavelength observation</h2>
            <p>The dust present in the interstellar medium is opaque to visual light. It is more transparent to far-infrared, which can 
                be used to observe the interior regions of giant molecular clouds and galactic cores in great detail.[55] Infrared is 
                also used to observe distant, red-shifted galaxies that were formed much earlier. Water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb
                 a number of useful portions of the infrared spectrum, so high-altitude or space-based telescopes are used for infrared
                  astronomy.[56]

                The first non-visual study of galaxies, particularly active galaxies, was made using radio frequencies. The Earth's 
                atmosphere is nearly transparent to radio between 5 MHz and 30 GHz. The ionosphere blocks signals below this range.
                [57] Large radio interferometers have been used to map the
                
                active jets emitted from active nuclei. Radio telescopes
                 can also be used to observe neutral hydrogen (via 21 cm radiation), including, potentially, the non-ionized matter
                  in the early universe that later collapsed to form galaxies.[58] </p>

            <h2>Modern research</h2>
            <p> In 1944, Hendrik van de Hulst predicted that microwave radiation with wavelength of 21 cm would be detectable from
                interstellar atomic hydrogen gas;[62] and in 1951 it was observed. This radiation is not affected by dust absorption,
                and so its Doppler shift can be used to map the motion of the gas in this galaxy. These observations led to the 
                hypothesis of a rotating bar structure in the center of this galaxy.[63] With improved radio telescopes, hydrogen 
                gas could also be traced in other galaxies. In the 1970s, Vera Rubin uncovered a discrepancy between observed 
                galactic rotation speed and that predicted by the visible mass of stars and gas. Today, the galaxy rotation problem
                is thought to be explained by the presence of large quantities of unseen dark matter.[64][65]
                <footer> </footer>
                Beginning in the 1990s, the Hubble Space Telescope yielded improved observations. Among other things, its data helped 
                establish that the missing dark matter in this galaxy could not consist solely of inherently faint and small stars.[66]
                The Hubble Deep Field, an extremely long exposure of a relatively 
                empty part of the sky, provided evidence that there 
                are about 125 billion (1.25×1011) galaxies in the observable universe.[67] Improved technology in detecting the spectra
                invisible to humans (radio telescopes, infrared cameras, and x-ray telescopes) allows detection of other galaxies that
                are not detected by Hubble. Particularly, surveys in the Zone of Avoidance (the region of sky blocked at visible-light
                wavelengths by the Milky Way) have revealed a number of new galaxies.[68]
                <footer> </footer>
                A 2016 study published in The Astrophysical Journal, led by Christopher Conselice of the University of Nottingham, used 
                20 years of Hubble images to estimate that the observable universe contained at least two trillion (2×1012) galaxies.[69]
                [70] However, later observations with the New Horizons space probe from outside the zodiacal light reduced this to 
                roughly 200 billion (2×1011)</p>

            <h2> Types and morphology</h2>
            <p> Galaxies come in three main types: ellipticals, spirals, and irregulars. A slightly more extensive description of galaxy 
                types based on their appearance is given by the Hubble sequence.Since the Hubble sequence is entirely based upon visual 
                morphological type (shape), it may miss certain important characteristics of galaxies such as star formation rate in 
                starburst galaxies and activity in the cores of active galaxies.[6]</p>
            <footer> </footer>
            <p>Many galaxies are thought to contain a supermassive black hole at their center. This includes the Milky Way, whose core
               region is called the Galactic Center.[73]</p>
